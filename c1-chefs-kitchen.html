  <h1>Fusing Empathy With Technology To Prosper</h1>

      Judging from the video, I believe the DBC experience is one that is unique in that students are given control over their education and are able to enrich their spirit and mind in the process.  The DBC experience is different for each student.  However, the student who totally surrenders themselves to the experience will prosper.

        I must say that I am very impressed with DBC and have been since I watched the video on fusing empathy with technology.  Those are two things that you rarely see together.  At that moment I realized that this was a place that cared about the wellbeing of their students.  This quality is very important to me.  I love the fact that DBC focuses on the person as a whole. This culture aligns perfectly with my values and scruples.

        I am beyond excited to start this journey at DBC!  So far I love the community the students have built.  It makes me feel supported and not alone.  I am a little nervous because this is something new, but I know that this is natural and I am comfortable with that.  However, I will not stay in that place of nervousness. I will go forth and try my best and give it my all!
