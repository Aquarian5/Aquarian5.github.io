     The world of programming can be very daunting for most, especially for beginners. There are fancy technical terms, methods, and best practices to consider that can confuse even the most well studied student or autodidactic. It is easy to confuse what git is, How Version Control Works, and why GitHub is not git. The beginner is left feeling lost and question how important these three resources are. In reality, Version Control, git, and GitHub are beneficial and makes producing code that much more efficient.

        Version Control tracks all of the modifications you have made to a file or set of files over a set period so that it is easier for you to revert back to previous copies of your file later on. This quality is great since it provides a ‘safety net’ for the user. For example, let’s say that the user unfortunately deleted a version of their file/work.  Using Version Control, this user could then go back and retrieve a copy of the lost file in its state prior to it becoming deleted. This saves the user much heartache and allows them to continue work on their project.

        Git is a type of version control that stores data locally. Git allows you to ‘commit’, ‘push’, and ‘pull’ your work on your computer. Each and every time you go to submit changes you have made to a file or files through git, it takes a snapshot of what your file(s) look like at that moment in time. It is then stored as a reference point for when you need to refer back to it later.

        GitHub is an awesome service that allows you to store your code online. GitHub works through a repository, which is a space devoted to storing your work. You can create your own repository (i.e. for your personal website) or fork the repository of another user. GitHub works with git and allows you to do the functions mentioned above. Programmers use GitHub because it allows for remote collaboration. One feature of GitHub that I really think is great is the fact that you can fork the repository of another user. Especially for beginners, like me, this helps me learn how other people code, best practices, and gives me something to study to improve upon my own code. With anything that is open to the public there are concerns about privacy and security.  However, from what I gathered from my research, it seems as if those using GitHub operates from a place of “good faith” and that the contributors join and share on GitHub because they would like to  advance the state of tech and promote social good through code.
