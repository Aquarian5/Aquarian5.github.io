      As a beginner, it is easy to get overwhelmed with concepts, especially when learning how to incorporate CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheets) into your code.  CSS makes your code prettier.  With CSS, you can choose a color for your site's background, select a font that matches your site's theme, or center your text.  For me, trial and error comes hand-in-hand with using CSS.  I didn't know that prior to starting.  However, as I dove deeper into CSS and what it can do for my projects, I realized that I had a hard time with positioning my elements.

      When positioning your elements, the three most common positions used are: absolute, relative, and fixed.<b>Absolute</b> position is the most powerful as you an place the element you are working with anywhere you would like.  However, you must adjust the css values of 'top' 'left' 'bottom' and 'right' to place it in position.<b>Fixed</b>position is not used often but when it is, you will be sure that those who visits your site will see the message/advertisement that you place in this position.  When something is int he fixed position, it will stay in the exact place you place in no matter how far up or down a user scrolls.  Finally,<b>Relative</b> position is deemed the most confusing and misused.  According to css-tricks.com, relative position means that it sits relative to itself but, if you add value to another positioning attribute (like 'top', 'bottom', etc), it will shift the opposite way.

      It could be very confusing trying to get these definitions stright.  However, the best way to learn is by doing.  Don't be afraid to open a new css document and play around with the different positions availible!
