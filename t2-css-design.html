        Learning how to program websites is hard.  It's even harder when you must design them and use CSS to do it!
    </p>

    <p>
        CSS, which stands for <i>Casscading Style Sheets</s>, is a <b>MUST<b> use when you are desparately trying to not make your website look like it is from 1998 (like mine does right now...I am learning!)With CSS you can do a lot of wonderful things to your site to make it appealing to you and your audience.  you can display photos, add nice borders, and even change the font of your text.  
    </p>
        When creating a website, positioning of your elements is key.  For example if you shift your text a little too much to the left, it could throw the flow/look of your site off.  To prevent this, you can set the position of a given element with positioning.  Absolute, relative, and fixed are the three commonly used positions (the static element is a default).  Although common, they could be confusing for a new programmer (like me).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Absolute</i></b> positioning allows you to put an element anywhere on the page you are working on.  You can position your element by using the left-bottom, top, and right attributes (values).  When using an absolute position, you must be aware if any other elements are also set to absolute.  This will then mean that your new element will assume a position relative to the older absolute element. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Fixed</i></b>positioning is said to be used rarely but can come in handy when you are trying to place an element in a position where you do not want it to move.  As the name implies, the element is 'fixed' in whatever position you set it to.  If you were to have a fixed element on your screen and you tried to scroll down the page to get rid of it, it would follow you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Relative</i></b>positioning is said to be the most misused.  According to csstricks.com, if you were to set en element in the relative position it means that you have set it "relative to itself." You must be aware to set the attributes of the left, top, right, and bottom in order for something to happen.

    <p>As I start to learn more about HTML and CSS, the more clear these concepts become to me. </p>
