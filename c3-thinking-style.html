      I must say that the first three weeks of DBC has been an awesome journey.  I have been able to connect with other students, learn about HTML5 and CSS3, discover the Ruby basics, and learn how to effectively solve a problem with another person (remotely I should add) through pair programing.  I love what I have both learned and acheived so far as I have pushed myself out of my comfort zone completly.  It still feels a lot awkward and weird but I am enduring it because my goal is to become a proficient and efficient software developer.  I truely believe I will.

      When learning, I grasp concepts the best when I hear and/or see them.  When this happens, my mind starts to turn...taking what was said and turning the info into pictures, a movie, and or a song.  This helps me to remember better.  Since learning how to program is an abstract thing, it has been a little difficult for me to make some things 'click.'  To solidify my learning, I usually follow up with a video tutorial.  I have found youtube to be a wonderful resource for me.
      Moving forward, I plan on budgeting time to continue to research concepts that I do not understand and continue to not be so hard on myself because I am a beginner and learning programming is hard!  I must cut myself some slack.  At the end of the day, I am doing the damn thing!

    </p>
      To expand the ways I work and learn, I will try to not rely so heavy on visual and just focus on learning from listening or even just reading.  I will set aside time after work and family obligations just for me where I can really hone in on my studies.
