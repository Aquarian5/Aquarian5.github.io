      This week in Phase 0 we dove head first into all things Ruby.  I will be honest, it was very overwhelming for me at first.  However, I took a deep breath and gave it all I had.  Besides, just jumping into it is the best way to learn.  Throughout the week, I was exposed to concepts such as methods, variables, and objects and how to utilize them properly.  I also learned how to shorten my code (called concatenating).  However, it was learning about arrays and hashes that really interested me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Ruby language, loops (a loop allows you to set parameters and run code until those parameters are satisfied or not if it is an infinate loop) and arrays go hand-in-hand, allowing you to complete the same tasks over and over as quickly as posible.  However, information from the loops need to be stored somewhere. An <b>array</b> allows you to "store" information to a variable, giving you the ability to retrive the information later on by calling that variable.

      An array looks like this:

          <p> array = ["milk", "cookies", "plate", "cup"]</p>

      Arrays use a box([]) to store values.  Starting with the first value from the left, you would count from 0 to the last value in the array.  It is weird to start counting from 0 (I really don't) but for this, you must.You would then place the value inside of the box to call that particular value based on its place (number).The value's number/key is essential.   Whew, did that make sense?  
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes are similar to arrays in that they also allow you to store information for later use.The difference is that you could set how the key(s) would look by naming the value between quotes.  Hashes allow you flexability (by naming values) but it essentally the same as arrays because you are still calling values but in a different way.  You would also put your hash inside of a curly bracket.

      An example of a hash is as follows:

                           <p>
                            hash = {"cat1"=>"Butters", "cat2"=>"Gracey", "cat3"=>"Fifi"}
                          </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I like using arrays as I find them easier to read. I know that as I progress in DBC, I will be seeing more of both.  I look forward to it!
